# Geological Landforms

A mod for the game Rimworld.

Adds 27 landforms to the game, which generate biome-independently and appear as "special features" in the info tab of the world map.
The goal of this mod is to make map generation more interesting and varied, compared to the vanilla experience
of simply having either a cliff or a coast on one edge of your map.
